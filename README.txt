# Predicting Causes of US Wildfires

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to predict the causes of wildfires in the United States. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of wildfire incidents, encompassing various attributes such as geographical information and weather conditions, we aim to uncover insights that can contribute to wildfire prevention and management efforts.

## Motivation

Wildfires pose significant threats to both human lives and the environment, making accurate prediction of their causes crucial for effective mitigation strategies. By harnessing the power of machine learning and data analysis, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of the factors contributing to wildfire occurrences, ultimately aiding in the development of proactive measures to mitigate their impact.

## The project includes:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into patterns and trends in wildfire data. The work flow is detailed from start to finish. 

2. There are 2 file that have gone through pre-process:
	-base_test_data.csv
	-base_train_data.csv

3. There are 3 external data files:
	-tobacco.csv
	-city_temperature.csv
	-state_county_long_lat.csv

(csv files from (2) and (3) are in the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13vthRypFQPTl3wB_frJse-f9m-q8uTu6?usp=sharing)
